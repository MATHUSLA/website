<h1>The MATHUSLA Experiment</h1><br>
MATHUSLA (Massive Timing Hodoscope for Ultra Stable neutraL pArticles) is a proposed detector at CERN with the aim of going online with the HL-LHC upgrade to the Large Hadron Collider in ~2025.<br>
<br>
Long-lived particles are a common feature in many theories of particle physics that extend the Standard Model and could solve mysteries like why gravity is so weak or the nature of dark matter.<br>
<br>
MATHUSLA is a large-scale, relatively simple detector for the HL-LHC that can detect neutral long-lived particles produced in the 14 TeV pp collisions. Its location on the surface\ shields it from backgrounds that constrain the ability of the MAIN detectors like ATLAS and CMS to look for many of these kinds of particles. The large size of MATHUSLA would also allow it to act as a cosmic ray telescope.<br>
